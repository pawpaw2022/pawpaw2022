## Glad to have you here!&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Smilies/Beating%20Heart.png" alt="Beating Heart" width="40" height="40" /> &nbsp; ![visitor badge](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=pawpaw2022.pawpaw2022)

I'm a full-stack software developer. I love making websites, learning new technologies and cooking. 

Though I am pursuing my computer science and mathematics degree in the beautiful city of San Diego, I consider myself a self-taught programmer. Throughout the past 3 years, I have been constantly striving to learn programming skills. I never get bored of programming in a single day as I trully believe passion leads to consistancy, and consistancy drives to success. If I can do it, so can you! 

I've completed some projects in recent years, and I am looking forward to building more as I am learning new technologies in the future.
